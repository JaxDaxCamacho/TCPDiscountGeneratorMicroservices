First we need to have Visual Studio Installed with the necessary .net Core SDKs.
After that we can just click on .sln file which will open the project.
Up top there's the debug runner, we should target the server app first and then the client one.
They should connect and work fine.
There's also a video of me doing this and running the TestProject

Thanks in Advance.
